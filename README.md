Daily Python Practice â€“ Data Analyst Skills

This repository is a collection of my daily programming practice files, focused on building and reinforcing the technical skills used by Data Analysts in real-world settings.

ðŸ“Œ Purpose

The goal of this repo is to:

Strengthen my Python for Data Analysis skills.

Build a consistent habit of hands-on coding.

Practice solving real-world data analyst tasks (cleaning, wrangling, EDA, visualization, automation).

Create a library of reference scripts for myself and others.

ðŸ—‚ Repository Structure

Each file is named by date

Each script simulates or works through a data analyst task, such as:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)

Automating routine analyst tasks

Integrating SQL queries or Excel/CSV files

ðŸš€ How to Use

Browse daily practice files to see different analyst-style workflows.

Open any .py file to review a self-contained exercise.

Adapt snippets for your own analysis or projects.

ðŸ”® Future Additions

SQL daily practice tasks

Power BI / Tableau dashboards

Advanced Python (web scraping, APIs, ML preprocessing)Daily Python Practice â€“ Data Analyst Skills
